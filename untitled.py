Programmer simulator: A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games,
generally designed to closely simulate real world activities. A simulation game attempts to copy
various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training,
analysis, or prediction. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player
instead allowed to control a character or environment freely.

interactive fiction: Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments
in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in
this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of interactive narratives or
interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the
form of an adventure game or role-playing game.

platformer: Cinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre of platform games, usually
distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional platformers. These games focus on
fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games.
To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with Prince of Persia, have employed
rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing
the same stunts.

Game story:

Space traveler Persephone awakens in a strange place after her ship sustains heavy damage and
crashes. Following the crash, Persephone is contacted by the ship's onboard AI, Dee. Along with
Dee, Persephone travels through the alien forest in an effort to find her ship, and must go through
the process of repairing Dee's damaged code. During Persephone's journey, she is presented with
puzzles to better understand her predicament, and also to figure out how to fix Dee. Away from her
ship, Dee must relying on nothing but herself to survive.

* Since Persephone has no weapons, there is no way to shoot any approaching enemies.

* Persephone crashed on an alien world, so enemies can be anywhere and anything.

* Because the planet is alien, gravity can be different, which may affect Persephone’s jump and
movement abilities.

*Persephone needs to fix their damaged spaceship, which requires collecting items to do so. Right
now, coins are available, but other items may be available later.
